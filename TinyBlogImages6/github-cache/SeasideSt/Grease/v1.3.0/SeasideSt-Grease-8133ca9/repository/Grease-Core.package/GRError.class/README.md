This class provides consistent initialization and exception signaling behaviour across platforms. All platforms must provide the ANSI-standard signaling protocol on this class. #signal: can therefore be safely called on any subclass.

Packages that are using Seaside-Platform should usually subclass GRError instead of Error.
