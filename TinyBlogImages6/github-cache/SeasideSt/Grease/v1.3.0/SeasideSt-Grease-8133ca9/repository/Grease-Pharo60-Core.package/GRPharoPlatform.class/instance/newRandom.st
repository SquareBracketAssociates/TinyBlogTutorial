	"Answers the random number generator to be used to create session and continuation keys. Make sure it is seeded. They only methods that will be sent to it are:
	  #nextInt: - should answer a random integer in the interval [1, anInteger]
	  #randomFrom: - should answer a random element from the given collection
	
	Make sure that both methods are safe under heavy concurrent load.
	
	Used by Gemstone/S traditional Randoms which cannot be persisted.."
